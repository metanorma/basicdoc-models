class HierarchicalSection{
  definition {
    Sections: groups of blocks within text, which can also contain other sections. 
  }
  +subsections: HierarchicalSection[0..*] {
    definition {
      Sections contained within the current section. The relation is recursive, 
      so the hierarchical arrangement of sections can be arbitrarily deep.
    }
