class ContentSection {
  definition {
    Prefatory sections of text, outside the main flow of text.
    In the BasicDocument model these are treated as equivalent to Hierarchical Sections. 
    (The distinction is currently reserved for downstream models such as Metanorma, which differentiates structurally between prefatory sections and sections in the main body of the text; differences between the two may be introduced in the Basic Document model at a later date.)
