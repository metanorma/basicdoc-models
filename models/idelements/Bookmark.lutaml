class Bookmark {
  definition {
    Anchor for cross-references which do not have scope over blocks or sections. Anchors within a block under the BasicDocument model cannot span across a number of inline elements; bookmarks are intended as point anchors. For that reason, the Review block has a starting reference and an optional ending reference, which can be bookmarks as well as block or section references.
