BasicDocument ("BasicDoc") / SecureDoc is a set of core information models that
represents a document, including metadata and rich text.

BasicDocument is a document model that can serve as a transit data structure
for document (with rich-text) conversion, such as taking input from AsciiDoc or
Markdown and converting them into an output format like Metanorma StandDoc.

Its rich-text models act as a superset to the semantic elements of HTML and
RTF, and therefore can fully represent the semantics of either format.

BasicDocument also provides models relating to document changes (i.e.
"document/content patches"), which can be used in the case of collaborative
transformation operations.

NOTE: BasicDocument is the document model that Selagraph operates on.
